## 🌱 What I Work On

I combine environmental systems thinking with machine learning.

My focus is clear.  
Build models that respect physics, understand spatial structure, and remain stable under real-world uncertainty.

Right now, I work on:

- 🌡️ Climate extremes and non stationary behavior  
- 🗺️ Spatial modeling and hazard mapping  
- 🧠 Interpretable machine learning  
- 🔬 Hybrid modeling that blends physical reasoning with AI

## 🔎 Current Research Themes

### 🌡️ Climate Extremes

- 🔥 Heatwave detection and warming trend analysis  
- 🌧️ Extreme rainfall classification  
- 📈 Mann Kendall trend testing  
- 📊 Threshold behavior under changing climate signals  

I’m interested in how extremes evolve, persist, and shift under non stationary conditions.

### 🗺️ Spatial Environmental Systems

- 🧩 Raster and vector data integration  
- 📍 Spatial autocorrelation and Moran’s I  
- 🔥 Hotspot detection  
- 🗄️ PostGIS workflows  
- 📐 Scale effects and aggregation bias  

Climate signals are spatial. Models must respect that structure.
